# SellMe

SellMe was a "Pokemon Go" like Mobile Geolocation project in prototype stage. The player would run a shop to sell wares like swords, bows and armour. Clever organization of showcases and crafting new items out of others give the player the oppurtunity to squeeze out the best prices of the adventurers. To obtain new items the Player can start journeys connected to the geolocation and stepcounter of the Phone to find treasure chests.
